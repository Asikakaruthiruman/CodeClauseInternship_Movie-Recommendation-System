 CodeClauseInternship -Project 3 : Movie-Recommendation-System
 
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather movie-related data (e.g., titles, genres, ratings, descriptions). Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

Recommendation Approaches:
Collaborative Filtering (user-based or item-based) uses user interactions (e.g., ratings, watch history) to suggest similar movies. Content-Based Filtering recommends movies based on features like genre or description. A Hybrid Approach combines both for better results.

Model Training:
Train the model using algorithms like k-NN, SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), or ALS (Alternating Least Squares) for collaborative filtering and TF-IDF or Word2Vec for content-based filtering.

Prediction and Recommendations:
Generate movie recommendations for users based on their past preferences or inputted preferences, such as favorite genres or movies theyâ€™ve enjoyed.
